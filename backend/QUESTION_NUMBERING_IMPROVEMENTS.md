# Question Indexing and Numbering Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Question Numbering Inconsistency**
**Problem**: MCQ questions had numbers in content, but other question types didn't have consistent numbering.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented section-specific question numbering for all question types
- Each question type now has its own numbering sequence starting from 1
- Questions are numbered within their respective parts (Part I, II, III, etc.)

**Example**:
- MCQ: "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6" (Part I)
- True/False: "1", "2", "3", "4", "5" (Part II) 
- Matching: "1" (Part III)
- Short Answer: "1", "2" (Part IV)
- Long Answer: "1", "2" (Part V)

### 2. **Question Content Formatting**
**Problem**: Non-MCQ questions didn't have their question numbers prefixed in the content.

**Solution**:
- For non-MCQ questions, added section-specific numbers at the beginning of content when not already present
- True/False questions without explicit numbers now get proper numbering (e.g., "1. Is a stove used to wash clothes?")

### 3. **Question Type Correction**
**Problem**: "essay" questions should be "long_answer" to match the actual question type.

**Solution**:
- Changed all references from 'essay' to 'long_answer'
- Updated question statistics to use 'long_answer_count'
- Updated all data structures and processing logic

### 4. **Matching Questions Numbering**
**Problem**: Matching questions were numbered as "match_1" instead of proper section numbering.

**Solution**:
- Updated table processing to use section-specific numbering
- Matching questions now use "1", "2", etc. instead of "match_1", "match_2"
- Column A and Column B information is preserved

### 5. **Section-Specific Question Tracking**
**Problem**: Questions were numbered globally instead of being reset for each part.

**Solution**:
- Implemented `section_question_counts` dictionary to track questions per section
- Each question type maintains its own counter
- Counters are incremented only when questions are successfully processed

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Updated Question Type Dictionary
```python
questions_by_type = {
    'mcq': [],
    'true_false': [],
    'matching': [],
    'short_answer': [],
    'long_answer': [],  # Changed from 'essay'
    'fill_blank': [],
    'other': []
}
```

### 2. Added Section Question Counters
```python
section_question_counts = {
    'mcq': 0,
    'true_false': 0,
    'matching': 0,
    'short_answer': 0,
    'long_answer': 0,
    'fill_blank': 0,
    'other': 0
}
```

### 3. Improved Question Processing Logic
- Section-specific numbering for all question types
- Proper content formatting with question numbers
- Better handling of questions without explicit numbers

### 4. Updated Statistics Tracking
```python
"question_statistics": {
    "total_questions": len(questions),
    "mcq_count": len(questions_by_type.get('mcq', [])),
    "true_false_count": len(questions_by_type.get('true_false', [])),
    "matching_count": len(questions_by_type.get('matching', [])),
    "short_answer_count": len(questions_by_type.get('short_answer', [])),
    "long_answer_count": len(questions_by_type.get('long_answer', [])),  # Updated
    "fill_blank_count": len(questions_by_type.get('fill_blank', [])),
    "other_count": len(questions_by_type.get('other', []))
}
```

## JSON Output Example

### Before (Issues):
```json
{
  "number": "match_1",  // ❌ Wrong format
  "content": "Match: ...",
  "type": "matching"
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```json
{
  "number": "1",        // ✅ Proper section numbering
  "content": "1. Match: ...",  // ✅ Number included in content
  "type": "matching",
  "column_a": "1. Something sour...",
  "column_b": "A. Lime..."
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Numbering**: All question types use section-specific numbering (1, 2, 3, etc.)
2. **Better Clarity**: Question numbers are clearly visible in content for all types
3. **Proper Structure**: Questions are organized by their exam parts (Part I, II, III, etc.)
4. **Enhanced JSON**: More structured and usable JSON output
5. **Matching Questions**: Column A and B information properly preserved
6. **Type Accuracy**: Correct question type classification (long_answer vs essay)

## Test Results

✅ **MCQ Questions**: 6 questions numbered 1-6
✅ **True/False Questions**: 5 questions numbered 1-5  
✅ **Matching Questions**: 1 question numbered 1 (with column info)
✅ **Short Answer Questions**: 2 questions numbered 1-2
✅ **Long Answer Questions**: 2 questions numbered 1-2

All questions now have proper section-specific numbering and clear content formatting!
